üíä ***Clinical Trial Performance & Adherence Monitoring System***
* A comprehensive project utilizing **data analysis, machine learning, and a modern web dashboard** to optimize the management of multi-site clinical trials. This system provides trial managers with real-time visibility into recruitment funnels, site performance, and a predictive model to flag patients at high risk of dropping out.



‚ú® ***Key Features***
This project delivers a full-stack solution to address critical pain points in clinical trial management:
1. **Recruitment Funnel Visualization:** Track the patient journey from Screened to Enrolled to Randomized with clear performance metrics like Screen Pass Rate and Enrollment Velocity.
2. **Site Performance Leaderboard:** Benchmark sites against key performance indicators (KPIs) like enrollment count and data completeness to identify top performers and areas needing intervention.
3. **Patient Adherence Dashboard:** Monitor vital metrics, including Medication Adherence % and Missed Visits, to proactively flag "at-risk" patients and improve retention strategies.
4. **Predictive Dropout Modeling:** A machine learning pipeline developed in the accompanying notebook uses patient demographics and early trial data to predict the likelihood of patient dropout, driving timely intervention.
5. **Secure & Scalable Architecture:** Built on a modern, robust tech stack (React and FastAPI) designed for multi-site data integration and real-time updates.
